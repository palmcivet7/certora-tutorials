This repository contains the code examples for the
[Certora Prover Tutorials](https://docs.certora.com/projects/tutorials/en/latest/).
The [Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/) is a formal verification tool for
smart contract. The tutorials are part of the
[Certora Prover Documentation](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/).
